Hi!, my name is Bryan Rolando and...

I'm a passionate programmer who likes to find out how things works. Over the years I have used several technologies and programming languages that spans from low level ones like C and C++ to script langs like Ruby. Nowadays I focus mostly on the .NET framework; using C#, WPF, WCF, SQL, and such to build Line Of Business applications.

One of the aspects that defines me is that I'm autodidact, so I always try to learn something new and keep building from previous knowledge.
